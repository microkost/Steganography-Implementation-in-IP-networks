local values = outgoing - what I am sending, what is
remote values = incoming - what I expect from oposite side

How to implement CLIENT
SYN
seq local = generated
ack local = 0
seq remote = dont know now
ack remote = seq local + 1

ACK
save received seq to seq remote
seq local = ack remote
ack local = seq remote + 1
//what remote?

DATA
seq local = ack remote

DATA ACK


How to implement SERVER
SYNACK
seq remote = save received seq
ack remote = 0
seq local = generated
ack local = seq remote + 1

ACK DATA
